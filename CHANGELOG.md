# Changelog

All notable changes to vincent are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the pre-1.0 caveat spelled out
in [Versioning and stability](#versioning-and-stability) below.

This file is curated by hand. Each GitHub release additionally carries a
generated list of the commits between two tags, grouped by Conventional Commit
type — that is the exhaustive index; this is the human summary.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`vincent gc` reclaims directories no task claims.** A worktree could outlive
  every reference to it: deleting a project removes worktrees best-effort and
  drops the task rows regardless, so a removal that failed — a file locked by
  another process, a shell sitting in the directory — left a directory nothing
  could ever name again. A crash between creating a worktree and recording its
  path did the same, and made the task's next admission fail
  `worktree_path_occupied` pointing at a directory the user had never been told
  about.

  `vincent gc` lists those directories with their sizes and removes them.
  `--dry-run` prints the identical report and removes nothing. A worktree with
  local changes (untracked files count) is skipped as `worktree_dirty`; one whose
  repository is gone, so `git status` cannot run at all, is skipped as
  `dirty_unknown` — the common case for a real orphan — and `--force` removes
  both. Orphaned transcript directories are reclaimed too, since retention walks
  task *rows* and a cascade-deleted row's transcripts are reached by no pass.
  Nothing outside `{data_dir}/worktrees` and `{data_dir}/transcripts` is ever
  removed, no branch is ever deleted, and no task row is modified.

  New endpoints `GET /v1/maintenance/orphans` and `POST /v1/maintenance/gc`, and
  `orphans` on `GET /v1/info`.

- **The daemon reports orphans at startup and never deletes them.** One warning
  per directory in the log, plus the count on `/v1/info` and a line in the TUI
  daemon view naming `vincent gc`. The unattended path reports; a human deletes.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-15

### Added

- **Repository workflows for GitHub issues and releases.** The checked-in
  project registry now includes `github-issue`, `github-enhancement`,
  `github-bug`, `prepare-release` and `release`. `github-issue` turns a rough
  task into a `bug` or `enhancement` issue, parks in `awaiting_input` while
  Claude asks for missing detail, and puts a manual gate before the
  non-retrying `gh issue create`; it is POSIX-only and deliberately leaves its
  empty worktree branch behind.

  `github-enhancement` takes an open enhancement's id as the first token of the
  task title — `42`, `#42` and a full issue URL still work, and optional prose
  after that token now produces a useful branch and PR name — then separates
  clarification from implementation, runs the expensive cross-platform check
  without an agent retry, and gates the diff before the non-retrying push and PR
  creation. `github-bug` likewise proves a regression test red before fixing it.
  Both are Claude-only and POSIX-only; codex and cursor do not support the
  `on_input` clarification they rely on.

  `prepare-release` audits all six build targets, dependencies, archive
  contents, smoke assertions and pinned actions, lets an agent clear FAIL
  findings, and verifies a real `dry_run` artifact without publishing anything;
  its task-title version is optional. `release` follows `RELEASING.md` through
  preflight and the changelog PR, then stops at a manual gate before the tag.
  Its PR and tag steps do not retry, and everything after the tag only verifies
  the published result. `release` is Claude-only and POSIX-only.

- **Explicit child-process environments.** The new
  [`environment`](docs/reference/configuration.md#environment) config block
  applies to agent steps, command steps and checks: `inherit` accepts `all`
  (the unchanged default), `none` or a list of names; `unset` removes names
  next; and literal `set` values win last. An empty inherit list means nothing,
  `$` is not expanded in `set`, and a step's own `env` still wins. This makes
  hermetic runs possible and, on Windows, lets `unset: [MSYSTEM]` stop Cursor
  importing Claude Code hooks through the MSYS environment. The daemon logs
  resolved variable names, never their credential-bearing values or the values
  in a transcript, and warns rather than rewriting an environment with no
  `PATH` or Windows `SystemRoot`.

- **Richer output and complete transcripts in the TUI.** Tool calls now show a
  useful subject rather than only `Bash` or another bare tool name, followed by
  their success or failure; reasoning is marked with `·`, calls with `▸`, and
  outcomes are indented beneath them. Claude, codex and cursor all surface tool
  outcomes. Claude and cursor surface complete reasoning blocks, and codex now
  does too when its CLI emits the effort-dependent `reasoning` item. Long
  assistant text wraps with a hanging indent instead of disappearing past the
  output pane's right edge; tool output bodies remain in the raw transcript.

  Pressing `e` from either detail pane opens the selected attempt's complete raw
  JSONL transcript in `$EDITOR`, including the beginning omitted by the TUI's
  256 KB tail. The truncation notice advertises the binding, and a pruned
  transcript, a gate with no transcript, or an editor failure is reported
  instead of opening a misleading empty file.

- **Agent usage limits are now a wait, not a failure**
  ([task 003](docs/tasks/003-usage-limit-classification.md)). When a step stops
  because the agent's usage quota for the window is spent, vincent records the
  attempt as `usage_limit`, **consumes no retry**, releases the task's
  concurrency slot, and re-queues it until the window reopens — the step then
  re-runs with **no human action**. Previously that run was indistinguishable
  from a genuine failure: it burned the whole retry budget in seconds (there is
  no delay between attempts) and blocked the task with `agent_error`, which sent
  you to read a transcript about a task that was fine. With several tasks running
  on the same agent, the whole board went down at once.

  A held task shows when it resumes — `queued → 14:20` on the board,
  `queued · usage limit → 14:20` in the detail header — and gives up its slot, so
  other work carries on. The resume time is the reset the CLI reported; when it
  reports none, vincent waits
  [`usage_limit_recheck_interval`](docs/reference/configuration.md#usage_limit_recheck_interval)
  (new, default 15m) and tries again. Cancelling, pausing or resuming a held task
  drops the wait immediately.

  Only the **claude** adapter recognizes usage-limit wording today. Capturing a
  real quota exhaustion means burning a real five-hour window, so codex and
  cursor deliberately ship no pattern and behave exactly as before — a wrong
  guess would park a genuinely failed task in a wait it never leaves.

- **`agent_unauthenticated` block reason**
  ([task 003](docs/tasks/003-usage-limit-classification.md)). A claude step that
  fails because the CLI is not logged in now says so, instead of surfacing as
  `nonzero_exit` or `agent_error`. Nothing else changes: the step still runs, the
  retry budget still applies, and the task still blocks — the reason just names
  the fix.

- `queued_reason` and `admit_not_before` on every task in the API and on
  `GET /v1/config`'s `usage_limit_recheck_interval`. Both task fields are `null`
  for an ordinarily queued task, so the addition is invisible to existing
  clients, and they are separate from `block_reason`, which still means only
  "stopped, needs a human".

- **Homebrew install on macOS** ([task 002](docs/tasks/002-homebrew-tap.md)).
  `brew install lezli01/tap/vincent`. The cask clears the quarantine attribute
  during install, so macOS users no longer meet the Gatekeeper "unidentified
  developer" prompt or have to run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` by hand — the
  release binaries are still cosign-signed rather than Apple-notarized, so the
  archive path is unchanged. `brew uninstall --zap vincent` also unloads the
  LaunchAgent and removes the config and data directory. Linux and Windows keep
  the release archives and `go install`.

- **Configurable branch names**
  ([task 001](docs/tasks/001-configurable-branch-names.md)). A task's branch no
  longer has to be `vincent/{id}-{slug}`. Names resolve through a chain, most
  specific first: a per-task literal (`vincent task add --branch feat/OPS-123`, or
  `branch_name` on `POST /v1/tasks`), a project template
  (`branch_template` on `PATCH /v1/projects/{id}`), the global
  [`branch_template`](docs/reference/configuration.md#branch_template) in
  `config.yaml`, and finally the built-in name. **The default is unchanged**, so
  nothing moves unless you configure it.

  Templates get `{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Slug}}`, `{{.BaseBranch}}`,
  `{{.Fields.NAME}}`, `{{.Project.*}}` and a `slug` function. The new-task form
  previews the resolved name and the level it came from as you type, via
  `POST /v1/resolve`.

  Two things to know. Because vincent never deletes branches, a template with no
  discriminator in it collides on the *second* task for the same input — put
  `{{.ID}}` in it or expect to name repeats by hand. And `{{.Fields.x}}` fails
  loudly on a missing field while `{{ index .Fields "x" }}` renders nothing, which
  yields a legal-but-wrong name like `feat/-fix-login`; prefer the first.

- `branch_override` on `POST /v1/tasks/{id}/retry`, which makes a `branch_exists`
  block recoverable: the branch is renamed and the task re-admitted, keeping its
  id and history. Previously nothing in the API could change a branch name.

- `branch_name_invalid` block reason. Branch names are validated by
  `git check-ref-format` rather than a hand-rolled matcher, and a rejected name is
  reported rather than silently rewritten.

- `go run mage.go vuln` and a weekly `Vulnerabilities` workflow: govulncheck
  over the module's reachable code, swept across `linux`, `darwin` and `windows`
  because 15 packages (`x/sys/windows/svc`, `modernc.org/libc/*`) reach the
  binary on Windows only.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) and `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
- `go install github.com/lezli01/vincent/cmd/vincent@latest` as a documented
  install path, and a versioning-and-stability policy in the README and
  `SECURITY.md`.

### Changed

- **Normalized transcript and live-output clients must read structured tool
  records.** On
  `GET /v1/tasks/{id}/steps/{run_id}/transcript?format=normalized` and the
  per-task SSE stream, `agent.tool_use.tools` changed from `[]string` to
  `[{name, summary, call_id}]`; `agent.tool_result` adds
  `results: [{call_id, name, summary, is_error}]`, and `agent.thinking` adds
  whole-block reasoning text. Clients that rendered each tool as a string must
  read its `name` field and should tolerate the two new record types.
  Normalization happens on read, so stored raw transcripts need no migration
  and gain the richer rendering retroactively.

- A task's branch name is now resolved and written inside the same transaction as
  the task row, so no committed task can carry an empty one. This removes a window
  in which a crash between two writes left the name unset — harmless while names
  were derived from `(id, title)`, but it would have silently discarded a
  configured name and run the task on a default branch.
- `docs/` is no longer versioned: `docs/versions/v0/spec.md` is now
  [`docs/spec.md`](docs/spec.md), the single platform spec, amended in place.
  Planned work lives in [`docs/tasks/`](docs/tasks/README.md), the closed v0 ledger
  in `docs/history/`, and the gate walkthroughs in `docs/gates/`.
- A `go install`ed binary now reports the module version from `vincent version`
  instead of `dev`.
- CI runs the three acceptance gates as steps of one per-OS job rather than
  three separate jobs, sharing a checkout and a toolchain setup.
- Release notes are grouped into Features / Bug fixes / Other changes instead of
  one flat list of commit SHAs.
- Third-party actions in the release workflow are pinned to commit SHAs; every
  job carries a `timeout-minutes`.

### Fixed

- **Release binaries no longer depend on a stale vulnerable Go patch.** The
  module and release workflow now pin Go 1.26.6, which clears five reachable
  standard-library advisories across linux, darwin and windows instead of
  accepting whichever 1.26 patch happens to be on a runner. A weekly workflow
  proposes patch-only toolchain bumps within the declared minor series, and
  admits them only after build, test and the vulnerability sweep pass.

- **Installed daemons now start as the right user with a usable `PATH`.** macOS
  launchd and Linux systemd units capture the installing shell's `PATH`, so
  Homebrew, npm, nvm and `~/.local/bin` agent CLIs are visible after login;
  reinstall the service after changing that path. Windows now uses an
  unelevated, per-user Scheduled Task at login instead of a LocalSystem service,
  so the daemon shares the user's data, token, git config and agent credentials.
  The task pins the new internal `vincent daemon --config-dir` and `--data-dir`
  flags; only removing a legacy LocalSystem service still needs Administrator.

- **Windows login no longer leaves a daemon console open or a slow agent
  permanently unavailable.** The scheduled daemon's `--hide-console` path now
  releases the Windows Terminal console safely and starts agent probes without
  replacement windows, while a manually entered flag leaves the user's terminal
  alone. Failed probes expire after one minute instead of being cached for the
  daemon's lifetime, cold-login probes get 20/25-second bounds, and a timed-out
  Cursor status probe is no longer reported as definitely unauthenticated.
  `vincent service status` points users to `Task Scheduler Library\\vincent`, not
  `services.msc`, and diagnoses elevated task ownership that would prevent a
  later unelevated reinstall or uninstall.

- **The advertised output-tab keys now work.** `[` and `]` switch between the
  detail view's output tabs from either pane, as the help, palette and footer
  already promised; the existing `d` alias continues to make the same toggle.

- **The TUI answer form no longer truncates what it asks you**
  ([#83](https://github.com/lezli01/vincent/issues/83)). A question, an option
  label or a permission summary longer than the popup's inner width was cut with
  an `…` and there was no way to see the rest from inside the form — no wrap, no
  scroll, no expand — and because the popup is capped at 76 columns, a wider
  terminal did not help. That hid the end of an agent's question, the
  `(Recommended)` suffix agents put at the *end* of an option label, and, in
  `restricted` mode, the tail of the command you were being asked to approve.
  Rows now wrap inside the popup, with continuation lines indented under the
  marker so a wrapped option still reads as one option; `up`/`down` still move a
  whole option at a time, and the focused row is kept fully on screen.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-12

First release. All 70 tasks of the
[v0 breakdown](docs/history/v0-tasks.md) are complete, and the M1, M2, M4 and
M5 acceptance gates are met.

### Added

- **Daemon** owning all state and execution — SQLite (WAL, single writer),
  git worktrees, and agent CLI subprocesses. Work continues with no client
  attached; crash recovery finalizes interrupted step runs and kills verified
  orphans (PID *and* start time must match).
- **Localhost REST + SSE API** with bearer auth, the single interface every
  client uses.
- **Workflow engine** — YAML registry with builtin < global < project
  shadowing, live reload, and three step types (agent, command, manual) plus
  retries, timeouts and human actions.
- **Bubble Tea TUI** with six views (board, detail, new-task, projects,
  workflows, daemon), holding no state the daemon does not have.
- **CLI subcommands** over the same API.
- **Agent adapters** for Claude Code, Codex and Cursor. Capability differences
  are documented and ignored at run time, never emulated.
- **OS service registration** on Windows (Scheduled Task, as the invoking
  user), macOS (launchd) and Linux (systemd user unit).
- **Signed releases** — cross-compiled archives for linux/darwin/windows on
  amd64/arm64, SHA-256 checksums, a keyless cosign signature over the checksum
  file, and GitHub build provenance attestations.

### Security

- Agents run **full-auto by default** — a documented design decision
  ([spec §16](docs/spec.md)), surfaced once by the TUI on first run.
  Git worktrees isolate collisions between tasks, not privileges.
- The daemon's trust boundary is the OS user: loopback-only listener, bearer
  token stored `0600` in the data directory, and no agent credentials stored.

## Versioning and stability

vincent is `0.x`. Until `1.0.0`:

- **Breaking changes may land in any minor release** (`0.1` → `0.2`), and are
  called out under a `### Changed` heading here with the migration needed.
- **Patch releases** (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`) are fixes only, with no breaking
  change to the config file, the workflow YAML schema, the REST API or the CLI
  flags.
- The **config file, workflow schema, REST API and CLI surface are not stable
  yet.** Pin a version if you script against them.
- The **on-disk database migrates forward automatically** and is append-only by
  policy (`internal/store/migrations/`); downgrading a binary across a
  migration is not supported.
